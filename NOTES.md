    - Complete multiple challenges at the same time is multiplicative
      - Points awarded = Prior bonus (default 1) * challenge award
      - Up to 3 challenges can be completed at the same time, multiplying all the points awarded together
    - Steak points to add a multiplier to the points
      - Ex. Steak 100 pts, winning -> 120 pts (20% of the steak), loosing -> 0 pts
  - Spending points:
    - Playing any level other than level 0 costs points in some way or another
      - Rolling the dice moves the character up that many levels
    - Buying any number of replay tickets when the character avatar is ON the level

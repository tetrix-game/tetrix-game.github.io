            - No shuffling
          - Less ShapeOptions (doesn't allow for using powerups)
          - Clean:
            - Never more than X number of shapes on the screen
          - Cost:
            - Buy 10 more shapes for increacingly more points
            - Buying turns costs increacingly more point extra
            - Buying queue shuffles costs increacingly more point extra

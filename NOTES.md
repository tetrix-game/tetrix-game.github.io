## IMPORTANT NOTE: THIS FILE IS DEPRICATED. DO NOT USE!

- Header is too wide
- saveGameState takes too much too often, should only upsert state
- Points toast is too fast
- Shape placeholder
- Automatic game over calculation
- Error boundary is snarky, but only specifically for the rant effect. It needs to catch all errors
- action sounds
- clearance animations



- Ideas:
- Progress Board:
  - Shoots and ladders progression
    - Roll the dice, move that number of spaces
    - Ladders take the player up
    - Shoots take the player down

      - ROYGBP: Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Purple
      - Full rainbow every 128 levels
      - Reward is 10 X 2^n colors, 10, 20, 40, 80, 160, 320, 640

    - Ideas:
      - Shape placeholder
      - First occurance of a prime gives an explanation of the level type
      - Unlock modifiers at the prime modification level

        - Clear X number of 3X2
      - Game Instance Modifiers:
        - Efficiency:
          - Require a specific ratio of lines cleared to shapes placed
        - Limitation:
          - Less powerups:
            - No turning
            - No shuffling
          - Less ShapeOptions (doesn't allow for using powerups)
          - Clean:
            - Never more than X number of shapes on the screen

        - Rewards:
            - Turnable shapes unlock

# Challenge System

## Challenge Rolling Mechanics

### Default Behavior
- One challenge roll per game
- Highest prime challenge wins

### Upgrades
- Roll 2 pick 1
- Roll 3 pick 1
- Extra challenge slots: 2, 3, and 4

## Challenge Types

### Line Clearing Challenges
- Clear lines (any color)
- Clear lines (specific color)
- Clear 2 at a time
- Clear 3 at a time
- Clear 2x1 patterns
- Clear 1x2 patterns
- Clear specific column

### Pattern Challenges
- Make specific patterns on the board

## Prime Factorization System

### Default Challenge
Clear ${index} number of lines

### Prime Factor Modifiers

#### Factor of 2: Color System
- Always the gray color
- Additional factors of 2 add more colors
- Number of colors equals number of 2 factors in index
- **Color Sequence**: ROYGBP (Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Purple)
- Full rainbow every 128 levels
- Every 4th clearance pattern is color specific

#### Other Primes (To Be Defined)
- 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97, 101, 103, 107, 109, 113, 127, 131, 137, 139, 149, 151...

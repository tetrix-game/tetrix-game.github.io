# Game Modifiers System

## Modifier Categories

### Efficiency Modifiers
- Require a specific ratio of lines cleared to shapes placed
- Challenges players to be more strategic with placement
- Could scale difficulty based on required ratio

### Limitation Modifiers

#### Fewer Powerups
- No turning (rotation disabled)
- No shuffling (reroll disabled)

#### Reduced Shape Options
- Fewer ShapeOptions available (doesn't allow for using powerups)
- Creates resource scarcity

#### Clean Play
- Never more than X number of shapes on the screen
- Forces efficient board management

#### Cost Increases
- Buy 10 more shapes for increasingly more points
- Buying turns costs increasingly more points extra
- Buying queue shuffles costs increasingly more points extra
- Economic pressure system

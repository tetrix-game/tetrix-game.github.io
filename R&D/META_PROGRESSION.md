# Meta Progression System

## Character Movement on Meta Map
- Character should move around the meta map as player progresses
- Visual representation of player's journey through the game

## Progress Board Concept

### Shoots and Ladders Progression
- Roll the dice, move that number of spaces
- Ladders take the player up (advancement)
- Shoots take the player down (setbacks)
- Classic board game mechanics applied to level progression

## Implementation Notes
- Consider how this integrates with existing level system
- Dice rolling mechanics and randomization
- Visual design for the board layout
- Balance between skill-based progression and chance

# Sound Effects Ideas

## Placement Sounds
- **Invalid placement sound**: "sheew back" effect when a shape cannot be placed
- **Valid placement calculation sound**: "tick" sound for valid placement
- **Invalid placement calculation sound**: "tock" sound for invalid placement calculation

## Implementation Notes
- These sounds should provide immediate audio feedback to enhance user experience
- Consider volume balance to avoid being intrusive
- Sounds should be crisp and responsive

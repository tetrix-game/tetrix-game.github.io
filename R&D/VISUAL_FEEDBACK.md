# Visual Feedback Enhancements

## GemShower Animation Improvements
- GemShower should go from center out then to the points bar exactly where the gem is
- This creates a more satisfying visual flow for scoring events

## Purchase Feedback
- Purchases should have a falling gem with a negative sign, number, and sound
- Visual indicator that currency is being spent
- Should mirror the GemShower effect but in reverse (subtractive)

## Implementation Considerations
- Animation timing should feel smooth and satisfying
- Consider performance implications for multiple simultaneous animations
- Coordinate with sound effects for complete feedback loop
